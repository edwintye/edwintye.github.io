You have landed at the hidden page, so I guess I should briefly talk about myself.

I am a Data Scientist turned Site Reliability Engineer, now hangs around in production rather than POC.  I studied
operations research during my PhD mainly working on forecasting.  After a couple of jobs where I spent more
time being a software engineer making my models work in production rather than doing research like work,
now I have fully embraced the notion of "going to prod" and do it on a daily basis.
