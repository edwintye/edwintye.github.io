This is a delayed post where I summarized my learnings by doing interviews, on both sides of the table, being
a candidate as well as being on the panel.  What I learnt in the past year is vastly differently compare
to all the time before due to a certain pandemic. This follows on from the series problems in data science interview
[part 1]( {{< ref "2021-05-08-problems-in-data-science-interviews-1" >}} ) and
[part 2]( {{< ref "2021-05-23-problems-in-data-science-interviews-2" >}} ) where some
of the points are repeated here.  I am not really proposing solutions and merely writing down my thoughts.

## Almost no one is prepared for remote interviews

Rather unsurprisingly, companies are not very prepared apart from the telephone interview stage.  Setting up
a (video) call was hard and tech issues regularly occur.  Hearing people turning off their video to save
some bandwidth was common; as much as that sounds okay for internal communication, I really can't recommend
that for an interview.  I myself gave up on WiFi at some point and bought an ethernet adapter
(with some extra usb&ndash;c port) for under 50, and
cannot recommend enough given the stability my internet connection has been since.

We can all make excuses in the first few months of the pandemic, but the tech or the staff's ability to
use the tech should be sorted after a year.  Any work place that is still struggling with a video conference
after a year is a cause for concern.  Similarly, if employees are facing difficulty then it may also hint
towards a lack of support and training in the organization.

## Experience in the cloud varies massively

As much as I don't want to use the term "cloud native" as a tag for classifying people, I can't deny the fact that
growing up with internet makes a difference. A 21 years old (born from the 00 era)
probably has a Github account, played with AWS/GCP/Azure free tier, and notions like CI/CD is just normal practice
rather than something to be celebrated. Obviously you can't expect everyone to know random details like
AWS lambda has a time limit, or an account can have 5 VPC before a support ticket is required to acquire more &mdash;
some random knowledge I gained through the painful way.  However, certain basic knowledge seems
to be almost guaranteed.

The familiarity is probably going to get worse over time, as the saying goes "rich gets richer".  Those who are
well versed in cloud technology gains the ability to move to a new company and learns even more in the area.
The older generation will most likely have a lot of other duties in their life, and the only chance
they get to learn is on company time.  If the company is slow at adopting cloud technologies, then it is
reflected in the employees experience, subsequently hindering them from moving away; a vicious cycle rewarding
those who spend their free time upskilling.  The trap continues for those who have greater real life commitments.
An admission of not having the necessary cloud exposure may lead to a decrease in remuneration when changing jobs,
a risk too great for some.

## Shifts in timeline

Average time between interviews greatly increased, with massive gaps between the interview stages.
This can be good or bad depending on your point of view: spending 3 hours on site more time commitment friendly
for all participants when compared to arranging 3 interview stages, but everyone gets to save time when
it is clear there is a mismatch after the first stage.  Furthermore, scheduling is easier especially if
a candidates can do say a 45 minutes lunch interview.

On the other hand, the multi&ndash;legged asynchronous communication that spans between the candidate and
hiring manager often lead to a slower feedback for the candidate.  I think the best way to reduce turnaround time,
be it is good or bad news, is for the interviewer/hiring manager to provide feedback directly rather
than go through HR/recruiter.  Unfortunately, not everyone will be in favor of adding a bit
of personal touch in the interview process.  Maybe all hiring managers should go through training on having
difficult conversations, something medical doctors receive as part of their education. 

## Companies need to (decide and) reinvent their selling point

Beer fridge is not that attractive anymore for those who have no desire to go into the office.  However,
I also know a lot of people who will love to go into the office, see people and do stuff with colleagues.
For those living in ssa city and shared house, the office environment is actually way better than their
room with minimal furniture.  From my limited observation, the willingness to go full remote is strongly
linked to demographics: those with a family living outside the city want a very different culture than
graduates who moved from a small town into the city for a job.  By announcing policies like "fully remote",
there is an implicit drive towards a certain type of culture, and I can't wait to see the result in
a few years time.
