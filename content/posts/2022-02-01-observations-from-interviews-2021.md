Continuation from the [post last year]({% post_url 2021-06-19-observations-from-interviews-2020 %}),
let's go through what I learn this year by doing interviews.

### Questions for who?

The questions can reveal more about the interviewer rather than interviewee.  More concretely,
we can usually tell what type of things the interviewer care about, or at least on
his/her mind when drafting up the interview plan.  If the candidate get asked about the different
methods of a tree search, then you can bet that the interviewer have spent way too much time
on that topic and feels really good about possessing that knowledge (even if completely useless).

### Conference talks are not good interview questions

Imagine someone asking you questions after being inspired by a conference talk, yup, that happens. As much
as the question may be excellent, those problems can be too advanced, in such a way that not even
the interviewer understands properly. Such questions will also bias those who has seen/heard of the
specific conference talk or similar ones.  Obviously, if the interviewer was the speaker, then (s)he may
feel most comfortable speaking and guiding a candidate through a problem in his/her day job.  Even
if the topic is uncommon or very hard, it will at a minimum be educational for all those involved. 

### Take home exercise or take forever exercise?

Take home exercise bias towards people who have a lot of time.  During the time of Covid, this is
especially obviously where both the quality and quantity increased substantially on the same test.
A candidate who has the ability to spend way over the recommended amount of time for a test
may be interpreted as *passion*, but if (s)he no longer has the luxury of spending the same amount of
time on the job then it may cause some unrealistic expectation.  In pretty much all the scenarios unless there
is a serious time constraint or the candidate does not have the ability, the best form of assessment is
to pair program over a problem. Not only will the time constraint be enforced, you can get
feedback and thought process in real&ndash;time.

### How do ~~you~~ we stay up to date?

There was a time when I loved asking the candidate "How do you stay on trend?".  I started because I was asked
that question before and felt it is informative; someone passionate in the field will want to keep up to date
with the cutting edge is a fair assumption.  Things changed when a candidate told me that they go to whichever
conference her manager/company decided to send her.  I was shocked because the immediate follow up &mdash; which
luckily she didn't ask &mdash; would be "What is the last 5 conferences/training courses engineers in your
team have been to?". Normally that is not a hard question, but the reality is that no one in our
department has attended any events during the pandemic!

After that experience, I made a slight adjustment to "What conferences would your like to attend if you join?"
which
1. is a much more neutral question that eliminate the need for them to lie if they haven't been to one recently,
2. and allows a smooth transition to talk about our plan in the future rather than the past.

Furthermore, the expectation that everyone needs to be super passionate to be good at their job is not true.
The requirement is that employees have the skills and ability to do their job effectively.  If the candidates can
bring additional knowledge and skills then great, if not, that's fine too as long as they can be brought to that
level.

Personally speaking, going to meetups in my own time because I can't resist some free pizza and beer is probably
fair game. But if a company expects me to pay my own conference fees and take personal leave to upskill, then
they are not in a position to ask me how to stay current.  The company should ensure that their employees get
sufficient training especially if they want to be at the cutting edge.
