In the [previous post]({% post_url 2021-05-08-problems-in-data-science-interviews-1 %})
I talked about issues with programming exercises, which is a substantial topic in
its own right.  This post explores some remaining interview types and their potential
problems.  To start things off, take a moment to think about the purpose of a technical interview.
Most people will probably take the phrase verbatim, because a technical interview is designed to gauge
the knowledge of the candidates.  Without a doubt this is necessary, and rather unfortunately, quite often
used in the wrong way.

### Preselected topics

Traditionally from the world of academia, where a lot of the data scientists are from,
researches with Doctoral degree are use to getting quizzed on their technical knowledge.  Whiteboard
exercise is a fairly good reflection of what happens between researchers on a regular basis; be it exploring
a technical idea in depth or conveying high level ideas as a sanity check, researches are quite capable
to have a discussion in their own field without preparation.  

In an interview setting the candidates usually don't get to choose the topic of discussion, and there are two ways
in which the interview has unintended effects.
1. The candidate is an expert in the topic,
2. or the candidate has no knowledge in the topic.

When the candidate knows more than the interviewer, it becomes hard to judge the level of expertise
and the interview may turn hostile.  I have seen this as the interviewer refuse to accept that
his/her knowledge is lacking, equally the candidate's slowly turns into having a condescending tone.
Obviously this reflects poorly on the interviewer more than anything else,
but it is hard not to be defensive when your mindset is set to "quiz the candidate" then backfires.  Alternative
is equally bad as the candidate become demoralized as (s)he sees that the requirement of the position and
knowledge differs significantly.  

There are times when a position requires special knowledge &mdash; where the job advert should be explicit about
the skills required &mdash; yet most jobs can be considered to be generalist roles.  Even when domain
knowledge is needed, the ability to learn is probably more important. A good approach therefore would be to
construct the questions around transferring the candidate's knowledge into the role applied for. What I
found useful is to allow people to describe their problem, approach, and what they learnt out of the experience.
At the end, the experience will lend itself to tackle similar problems in an organization.

### Whiteboard exercise and presentations

Describing personal experiences is a good way to do whiteboard exercises with candidates having complete control.
The other more common type of whiteboard exercise is of the form: write pesudo&ndash;code for an algorithm, or
solve this weird maths problem on the board.  Neither tests any real skills apart from
"how this person behaves under the spotlight".  I would argue that most jobs don't require us to
"stress test" a candidate.  Data scientist in general do not work under the same pressure as a support/Ops
role; the ability to remain calm and solve problem under the watch of many pairs of eyes is almost certainly
not part of the day job.

Expectation of a data scientist quite often include the presentation of findings to stakeholders.  Indeed,
they will be expected to stand in front of a room full of senior management, possibly up to the C&ndash;level.
A comparable situation is simply to ask the candidate to make a presentation on a hot topic and ask
business side colleagues to join the interview. Getting buy&ndash;in from the business side is crucial
and getting them engaged as early as the interview stage should be beneficial to all parties. At a minimum,
the product manager should participate as (s)he will often be the first to raise questions.

If securing time from the business side to participate in interviews is too challenging, sending them
the slide deck so they can provide feedback would still be beneficial. Scrolling through slides and
asking a couple of questions require as little as a few minutes.  Furthermore, time commitment on attending
an interview is very significant when compare to just look through a few slides on your own terms.
At the end of the day, replicating normal daily encounters will best reflect the suitability of a candidate,
and creating slide decks without ever presenting them is (rather depressingly) realistic!

### Final words

Although this post and the [previous post]({% post_url 2021-05-08-problems-in-data-science-interviews-1 %}) is
fairly critical of standard interview practice without very concrete solutions.  The reality is
that as long as the interviewers remain open&ndash;minded without fixating on a script, getting the candidate
to reveal  their skills, critical thinking, and aptitude should come naturally.  Bear in mind that the candidates
took their time to apply for a job and turn up to the interview, so they probably want you to be interested
and have a story to tell!
